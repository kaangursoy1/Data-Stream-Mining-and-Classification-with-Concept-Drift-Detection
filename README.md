# Data-Stream-Mining-and-Classification-with-Concept-Drift-Detection
Overview
This project focuses on developing and analyzing data stream classification models with concept drift detection. Data stream classification is essential in environments where data arrives continuously over time, requiring models to update incrementally as new data becomes available. This project leverages the open-source Python library scikit-multiflow to implement various data stream classification techniques, with a special focus on handling concept drift and evaluating performance using the prequential evaluation method.

Key Objectives
Implement adaptive data stream classifiers that can update incrementally as new data arrives.
Handle concept drift by incorporating drift detection mechanisms, ensuring that models adapt to changes in the data distribution over time.
Evaluate models using prequential evaluation, a test-then-train approach commonly used in data stream mining to assess model performance as data arrives.
Build a custom ensemble model from scratch using Hoeffding Tree Classifiers as base learners and implement a drift detection strategy.
Implementation Details
Data Stream Concepts

Data Stream Classification: Models are trained incrementally, updating with each new instance instead of being trained on a static batch.
Concept Drift Detection: Adaptive models identify changes in the data distribution, adjusting to new patterns over time.
Prequential Evaluation: The model's performance is tested on each incoming instance before training, simulating real-world stream processing.
Datasets Used

Synthetic Data Streams:
AGRAWALGenerator and SEAGenerator from scikit-multiflow are used to generate 100,000 data instances each.
Concept drift is applied to simulate evolving data streams.
Real Datasets:
Spam and Electricity datasets are used to evaluate the models in real-world scenarios.
Datasets can be accessed from this GitHub repository.
Classification Models Implemented

Adaptive Random Forest (ARF)
Streaming Agnostic Model with k-Nearest Neighbors (SAM-kNN)

Dynamic Weighted Majority (DWM)
Custom Ensemble Model:
Built from scratch using Hoeffding Tree Classifiers as base learners and drift detection mechanisms.
The ensemble adapts dynamically to changes in the data stream.
Evaluation Metrics

Overall Accuracy: Measures the percentage of correct predictions across the entire data stream.
Prequential Accuracy: Calculated over sliding windows, tracking the accuracy of the model over recent data instances.
Prequential Accuracy Plot: Plots show the model's performance over time for each dataset, enabling visualization of changes due to concept drift.
Results
Accuracy Comparison: Each classifier's performance is measured using overall and prequential accuracy. Models are tested on both synthetic and real datasets.
Prequential Accuracy Plots: Show the changes in model performance over time, indicating how well the models adapt to concept drift.

Challenges
Handling Concept Drift: Effectively identifying and adapting to concept drift in real-time without compromising accuracy.
Building a Custom Ensemble Model: Implementing a drift-aware ensemble from scratch, which required careful integration of drift detection mechanisms.
Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the implementation of adaptive data stream classification models capable of handling concept drift. The prequential evaluation approach provided a clear view of model performance over time, validating the effectiveness of each model in adapting to evolving data streams. The custom ensemble model highlighted the potential for dynamic adaptation in real-world applications.
